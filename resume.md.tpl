# Cover letter for Alex Lance $MY_EMAIL

#### Hi there,

I am writing to apply for the position of $JOB_TITLE and would like to find out
more about the role. $JOB_REASON


#### Why me?

My experience centers around Linux sysadmin (16 years) and LAMP web
application development (12 years). In recent time this has shifted into
continuous integration, and microservices development using Docker and Amazon
Web Services (2 years).

I've created microservices in Go, Python, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, and used AWS
Cloudformation to create full-stack infrastructure as code, starting from DNS
records down through to load balancers, scaling groups, etc and rolling custom
Amazon Machine Images, the whole shebang - including the creation of the
deployment pipelines to launch that infrastructure across different environments.


#### Stuff I can do:

>Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, RedHat/CentOS, Gentoo), Amazon Web Services, DevOps,
>Ansible, Cloudformation, Packer, Terraform, Git, Docker, Microservices, Bash,
>Python, PHP, Postgres, MySQL, Apache, CSS, HTML, Vagrant, VirtualBox,
>Sumologic, Splunk, Nagios, Jenkins

This word cloud doesn't really explain the usefulness that I bring to a company
though. In my opinion, getting the job done is two-thirds of what makes a good
employee, the other third is elevating the people around you. I have found
myself assisting the people around me for my entire career, and I love it. That
is a fundamental part of job-satisfaction for me - and who I am - I want to be
useful and helpful. That leads me to...


#### Open Source!

Before my fascination with DevOps I was a full stack web developer. In my
spare time I am/was the lead developer for an open source project, allocPSA
which I still run as a low maintenance SaaS business.

For the last decade or so I have provided courteous and professional technical
support for allocPSA, and the sourceforge.net forums contain hundreds of
examples of my ability to work with others and problem solve efficiently and
politely.

Another passion project of mine is Stagehand.com.au which is a facility that
I am providing for free to assist community theatre companies.


#### Other interests...

My other interests include print design, photography, theatre and film
creation, and also fiction writing. And OK, the Richmond Football Club (carn
Tigers!). I would hope this range of pursuits helps inform my ability to
communicate and design elegant and reliable solutions.


Kind regards,  
Alex Lance
