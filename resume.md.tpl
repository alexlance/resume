# Cover letter for Alex Lance $MY_EMAIL

#### Hi there!

I am writing to apply for the position of $JOB_TITLE and would like to find out
more about the role. $JOB_REASON


#### Why me?

My experience centers around Linux and application development and
**deployment**.  I specialise in **all things Linux and DevOps**, and
utilize the diversity of the Open Source eco-system daily.

*Eg: this resume was written in plaintext markdown using vim, templated lightly
with envsubst/gettext, pushed through a pdf converter gimli, and stored in git
for version control. All open source. See https://github.com/alexlance/resume*

```bash
envsubst < resume.md.tpl > resume.md
gimli -file resume.md && rm resume.md
```


#### Look what I can do!

Here's some things that I can do - and more importantly **enjoy**:

>DevOps, Linux, Jenkins, Ansible, AWS, Cloudformation, Packer, Terraform, Git,
ssh, Docker, Microservices fig/docker-compose, bash, Python, PHP, postgres,
MySQL, CSS, HTML, virtualisation, vagrant, virtualbox, vmware

I've recently started writing microservices using docker containers. I even
wrote a tool to help me wrangle all those microservices. I call it
[fug](https://github.com/alexlance/fug), because I got sick of an existing
tool's (fig) limitations. For example, having to do sequential builds, instead
of being able to build in parallel.

In my spare time I've been working on an automated deploy platform, that takes
a user's AWS security key, and deploys a fully provisioned Jenkins server into
their AWS account that monitors and iteratively deploys an application of their
choosing into their own AWS cloud.

So that when a programmer checks their code in to github, that application
automatically goes live ten minutes later. Hands-off infrastructure creation.
Uninterrupted/zero-downtime application deploys. Auto-scaling and
load-balancing based on realtime performance requirements.


#### Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?

Before my recent fascination with DevOps I was a full stack web developer. And
in my spare time I am/was the lead developer for an open source project,
allocPSA, which I still run as a low maintenance SaaS business.

For the last decade or so I have provided courteous and professional technical
support for allocPSA, and the sourceforge.net forums contain many examples of
my ability to work with others and problem solve effectively.


#### But do you eat babies in your spare time?

My other interests include print and product design, photography, theatre and
film creation, and also writing. And ok, the Richmond Football Club. (Carn
TIIIGES). This range of pursuits helps inform my ability to communicate and
design clean solutions.


Kind regards,  
Alex Lance
